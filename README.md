# EthicFlow

In our modern life, almost everything we buy comes off of a store shelf. In the age of globalization, our products can come anywhere, from a few miles away to to the other side of the world! EthicFlow provides transparency into these producers' ethics. Many websites show ethics, but they are incomplete, and it takes a lot of time to look up each company. If you wanted to buy Doritos, how would you know to look up their owner, PesiCo's practices instead? We solve these issues by providing a globalized way to lookup company data and view their practices. Not only do we show you the ethics of a product, but it as simple as scanning a barcode. No extra research needed! Together we can change the world. Even though we might have a small impact, together, with the simplicity of this application, we can promote ethical brands, and end unethical practices.
